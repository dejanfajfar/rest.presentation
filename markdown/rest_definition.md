_REST_ stands for __Re__presentational __S__tate __T__ransfer (sometimes spelled "ReST".). It relies on a 
 * stateless 
 * client-server 
 * cacheable 
 
communications protocol -- and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used.

REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications. The idea is that, rather than using complex 
mechanisms such as CORBA, RPC or SOAP to connect between machines, simple HTTP is used to make calls between machines.
