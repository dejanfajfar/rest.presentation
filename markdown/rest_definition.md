REST _(REpresentational State Transfer)_ is an architectural style, and an approach to communications that is often used
 in the development of Web services. The use of REST is often preferred over the more heavyweight *SOAP* 
 (Simple Object Access Protocol) style because REST does not leverage as much bandwidth, which makes it a *better fit* 
 for use over the Internet. The SOAP approach requires writing or using a provided server program (to serve data) and 
 a client program (to request data).
