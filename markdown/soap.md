_SOAP_ stands for __S__imple __O__bject __A__ccess __P__rotocol and was designed with the following in mind:

 * extensibility (security and WS-routing are among the extensions under development)
 * neutrality (SOAP can operate over any transport protocol such as HTTP, SMTP, TCP, UDP, or JMS)
 * independence (SOAP allows for any programming model)
